# RETROSPECTIVE

05/27/2021

## What did we do ?
- We did some cmake and CPM
- We wanted to build a extreme carpaccio client in cpp
- We have all dependencies to create an answer to server
- We updated CPM to latest version
- We made a copy of Bowling game kata to have all cmake config ready
- We debugged requests format using JS version of carpaccio


## What did we learn ?
- Patrice learnt on client/server problematic and REST requests


## Puzzle
- Dependencies handling in cpp is sport !
- We have the boost example of GET, will it work with POST ?
- Can we use boost to build the server ?

## Decide
- We miss some libraries in boost cmake so we need to add tham to build simple http client with boost
- We will add a Jira ticket to continue working on that
